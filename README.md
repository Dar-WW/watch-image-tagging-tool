### Image Data

The repository includes all watch images in the `downloaded_images/` directory. The expected structure is:

```
downloaded_images/
├── PATEK_nab_001/
│   ├── PATEK_nab_001_01_face.jpg
│   ├── PATEK_nab_001_02_face.jpg
│   └── ...
├── PATEK_nab_002/
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

If you need to add more images, place them in the appropriate watch folder following the naming convention.

## Usage Guide

### Viewing and Zooming Images

- Images are displayed in a 2-column grid with **interactive zoom controls**
- All images are **directly zoomable** - no need to open a separate view
- Each image has a toolbar at the top with zoom/pan controls

**How to Zoom and Pan:**
- **Zoom In/Out**: Use your mouse scroll wheel OR click the zoom buttons in the toolbar
- **Pan**: Click and drag anywhere on the image to move around
- **Box Zoom**: Click and drag to select an area to zoom into
- **Reset View**: Click the home/reset button in the toolbar to return to original view

### Tagging Images

**View Type:**
- Select **face** for front-facing watch face views
- Select **tiltface** for angled/tilted views

**Details Quality:**
- **Bad** (q1): Low detail quality, blurry, or poor image
- **Partial** (q2): Medium detail quality, acceptable
- **Full** (q3): High detail quality, clear and sharp

Changes are saved immediately when you click a button.

### Deleting Images

1. Click the **"🗑️ Delete"** button below the image
2. Image is immediately moved to `downloaded_images/.trash/{watch_id}/`
3. Deleted images can be recovered from the trash folder if needed

### Navigation

- **Previous/Next** buttons at the top AND bottom to move between watch folders
- Progress indicator shows current watch number (e.g., "1/72")
- **Jump to Watch** dropdown in sidebar to select any watch directly

### Sidebar Features

**Statistics:**
- **Total Images**: Total count across all watches
- **Tagged/Untagged**: How many images have quality tags
- **Deleted**: Number of images moved to trash
- **Quality Distribution**: Count of Bad (q1), Partial (q2), and Full (q3) quality images

**Jump to Watch:**
- Dropdown showing all watches with their tagging progress
- Shows format: `PATEK_nab_001 (2/4)` = 2 out of 4 images tagged
- Checkmark (✓) appears when all images in a watch are tagged
- Click to instantly jump to any watch

**Refresh Statistics:**
- Statistics update automatically when you make changes
- Use "Refresh Statistics" button if needed

### Alignment Annotation Mode

The Alignment mode allows you to annotate 5 keypoints on each watch image for geometric alignment tasks. Simply click on the image to place keypoints in sequence.

**How to Use:**

1. Switch to "Alignment" mode in the sidebar
2. Select quality filters (which images to annotate)
   - Bad (q1): Low detail quality images
   - Partial (q2): Medium detail quality images
   - Full (q3): High detail quality images
3. Select annotation status filter
   - All images: Show all images matching quality filter
   - Only unlabeled: Show images without complete annotations
   - Only labeled: Show images with all 5 keypoints annotated
4. For each image, **click directly on the image** to place 5 points in order:
   - **TOP**: Topmost point of watch face
   - **LEFT**: Leftmost point of watch face
   - **RIGHT**: Rightmost point of watch face
   - **BOTTOM**: Bottommost point of watch face
   - **CENTER**: Center point of watch face
5. Annotations save automatically after the 5th point is clicked
6. Use "Clear & Re-annotate" to redo any image

**Cross Helper Tool:**
- Click "✛ Helper" button to show a rotatable cross overlay on the image
- Two modes:
  - **📍 Annotate Points**: Click to place keypoints (default mode)
  - **🎯 Position Cross**: Click anywhere to move the cross center to that location
- Use "🎛️ Fine-tune Controls" to adjust rotation, position, and size
- The cross helps identify exact center points for precise annotation
- Cross overlay does not interfere with clicks

**Visual Feedback:**
- Each clicked point appears as a red X marker on the image with a label (T, L, R, B, C)
- Progress indicator shows which point to click next (e.g., "Click TOP (1/5)")
- Status shows completion: "Points: 3/5" or "✅ 5/5 points annotated"
- Previously placed points remain visible on the image
- Image is automatically sized to fit your screen

**Annotation Storage:**
- Annotations stored in `alignment_labels/{watch_id}.json`
- Coordinates normalized to [0, 1] range for resolution independence
- Each annotation includes:
  - Normalized coordinates for all 5 keypoints
  - Original image size (width, height)
  - Timestamp (ISO8601 format)
  - Annotator identifier

**JSON Format Example:**
```json
{
  "PATEK_nab_001_05_face_q3.jpg": {
    "image_size": [1024, 768],
    "coords_norm": {
      "top": [0.50, 0.10],
      "left": [0.20, 0.45],
      "right": [0.80, 0.45],
      "bottom": [0.50, 0.80],
      "center": [0.50, 0.50]
    },
    "annotator": "unknown",
    "timestamp": "2025-12-03T10:15:00Z"
  }
}
```

**Tips:**
- Click precisely on the watch face boundaries for accurate keypoints
- Annotations persist across sessions - you can close and reopen the app
- Re-annotating an image overwrites the previous annotation (no version history)
- If you make a mistake, use "Clear & Re-annotate" to start over
- The image is scaled to fit your screen, but coordinates are saved at full resolution

## Filename Format

Tagged images follow this format:
```
{WATCH_ID}_{VIEW_NUM}_{VIEW_TYPE}_q{QUALITY}.jpg
```

Examples:
- `PATEK_nab_042_04_face_q3.jpg` - face view, full quality
- `PATEK_nab_049_06_tiltface_q2.jpg` - tiltface view, partial quality
- `PATEK_nab_001_03_face_q1.jpg` - face view, bad quality

## Tips

- Images are larger in the 2-column layout for better detail inspection
- Use the sidebar statistics to track your overall progress
- Jump to watch dropdown is useful for skipping to specific watches or reviewing completed ones
- Checkmarks (✓) in the watch dropdown indicate fully tagged watches
- Quality tags help filter training data by image clarity
- Deleted images can be recovered from the `.trash/` folder
- Statistics update automatically as you tag images
- Navigation buttons at both top and bottom save scrolling time

## Troubleshooting

### "No watch folders found in downloaded_images/"
- Make sure you have watch folders in the `downloaded_images/` directory
- Each folder should contain `.jpg` image files

### Port already in use
- Streamlit default port is 8501
- If it's already in use, Streamlit will automatically try the next port
- You can specify a different port: `streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502`

### Images not loading
- Check that image files are in `.jpg` format
- Ensure filenames match the expected pattern: `{WATCH_ID}_{VIEW_NUM}_{VIEW_TYPE}.jpg`

## Technical Details

- **UI Framework**: Streamlit
- **Image Processing**: Pillow (PIL)
- **Interactive Zoom**: Plotly (for tagging mode)
- **Alignment Annotation**: streamlit-image-coordinates (for click-based point placement)
- **File Operations**: Python standard library (os, shutil)
- **Data Storage**: JSON files for alignment annotations
